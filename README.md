The platform provides a simple and engaging interface for browsing a wide variety of pets, exploring categories, and finding essential information about each pet. In this project, JavaScript's ES6 features are demonstrated along with fetching data from REST API using relevant methods and keywords of JavaScript. Besides, error handling features are used wherever it is needed.

- Adopt pets directly through the platform.
- Sort pets by price to find the best deals.
- Responsive design with smooth scrolling and mobile-friendly UI.

- **Template Literals:** Dynamically generated HTML and strings with template literals (e.g., `` `...${data}...` ``).
- **Destructuring:** Extracting data from arrays or objects into variables (e.g., `const { category_icon, category } = element;`).
- **Modules (import/export):** For managing different parts of the application in modular code, enhancing maintainability.
